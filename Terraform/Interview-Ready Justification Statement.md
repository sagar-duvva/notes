## 🎯 Interview-Ready Justification Statement

**Q: Your team already uses ARM templates or Bicep. Why would you recommend switching to Terraform?**

**A:**

> While ARM templates and Bicep are powerful for Azure-specific workloads, Terraform offers several strategic advantages:
> 
> - It supports **multi-cloud** deployments and can manage other resources like **DNS, GitHub repos, Kubernetes, etc.**, all in one tool.
>     
> - Terraform's **modular design** and **state management** make it easier to build scalable, version-controlled infrastructure.
>     
> - It also provides a **strong DevOps ecosystem** with testing tools (`tflint`, `tfsec`), module registries, and advanced CI/CD integrations.
>     
> - If our organization plans to scale or follow IaC best practices across teams or clouds, Terraform is the better long-term choice.
