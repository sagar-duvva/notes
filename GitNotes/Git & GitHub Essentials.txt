# **📘 1. CLASSROOM HANDOUT — Git & GitHub Essentials**

# =========================================

**TITLE:** *Git & GitHub: Classroom Handout*
**AUDIENCE:** Beginner–Intermediate
**DURATION:** 2–3 lab sessions



---
---
---



# **Section 1 — What Is Git?**

Git is a distributed version control system that lets teams track changes to files, collaborate, and review history.

**Key Terms**

* **Repository (repo)** – project folder tracked by Git
* **Commit** – snapshot of project state
* **Branch** – parallel line of development
* **Merge** – bring branches together
* **Remote** – online copy of your repo (GitHub)



---
---
---



# **Section 2 — Installing & Configuring Git**

### Install Git

* Windows/Mac/Linux: [https://git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)

### Configure identity

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```



---
---
---



# **Section 3 — Creating & Managing Repositories**

### Create a repo

```
mkdir project
cd project
git init
```

### Check status

```
git status
```

### Add + Commit

```
git add file.txt
git commit -m "Add file.txt"
```



---
---
---



# **Section 4 — Branching & Merging**

### Create branch

```
git switch -c feature-1
```

### Merge

```
git switch main
git merge feature-1
```



---
---
---



# **Section 5 — Working With Remotes**

### Add remote

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

### Push / Pull

```
git push origin main
git pull origin main
```



---
---
---



# **Section 6 — Pull Requests on GitHub**

1. Push your branch
2. Open GitHub → **Pull Requests**
3. Click **New Pull Request**
4. Describe change
5. Request review
6. Merge after approval



---
---
---



# **Section 7 — Best Practices**

* Use clear commit messages
* Create feature branches for each change
* Pull before you push
* Avoid editing on `main`
* Use `.gitignore`
* Keep PRs small & focused



---
---

# =========================================

# **📗 2. ADDITIONAL PRACTICE LABS (WITH SOLUTIONS)**

# =========================================

Below are **five extended labs** for practicing real-world situations.
Each includes **objective, instructions, expected output, and solution**.

---

# **LAB A — Rewriting Commit History (Beginner → Intermediate)**

### **Objective**

Fix incorrect commit messages using interactive rebase.

### **Instructions**

1. Create three files and commit with poor messages like:

   * “update”
   * “stuff”
   * “more stuff”
2. Rewrite messages using rebase.

### **Commands**

```
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

### In the editor

Change:

```
pick 84fd111 update
```

To:

```
reword 84fd111 update
```

### **Expected**

Rewrite messages to:

* “Add login page”
* “Implement header UI”
* “Fix CSS spacing”

---

## **Solution Summary**

Interactive rebase opens a list of commits. Mark any commit as `reword`, save, enter the corrected message, and continue until rebase completes.

---
---



# **LAB B — Resolving Merge Conflicts in Multiple Files**

### **Objective**

Simulate a multi-file conflict.

### **Instructions**

1. Create branch `feature-text`.
2. Modify `index.html` and `style.css`.
3. Switch to main and modify the same lines differently.
4. Merge.

### **Expected Conflicts**

Both files show `<<<<<<< HEAD` markers.

### **Solution Summary**

Remove conflict markers and manually choose the correct combined versions.
Then:

```
git add .
git commit
```



---
---
---



# **LAB C — Forking & Contributing to an Open-Source Project**

### **Objective**

Perform an open-source style contribution workflow.

### **Instructions**

1. Fork a repo (e.g., a small JavaScript library).
2. Clone your fork.
3. Create branch: `fix-typo-docs`.
4. Update documentation.
5. Push and create PR.

### **Expected**

A GitHub PR with a clear summary and linked issue number.

---

## **Solution Summary**

Students demonstrate:

* Forking
* Branching
* Committing
* Pushing
* Opening PRs



---
---
---



# **LAB D — GitHub Issues + Project Boards**

### **Objective**

Track tasks using Issues & GitHub Projects.

### **Instructions**

1. Create an Issue titled “Add responsive nav bar”.
2. Add labels: `enhancement`.
3. Convert it to a task card on a Project Board.
4. Link a pull request to auto-close the issue.

### **Expected**

PR description includes:

```
Closes #1
```



---
---
---



# **LAB E — CI/CD with GitHub Actions (Beginner Pipeline)**

### **Objective**

Automate tests on push events.

### **Instructions**

1. Create `.github/workflows/test.yml`
2. Add simple workflow:

```
name: Run Tests
on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run test script
        run: echo "All tests passed!"
```

---

## **Expected**

Workflow passes on GitHub → Actions tab.

# **📺 3. VIDEO-STYLE MINI LESSONS (SCRIPT + STORYBOARD)**

# =========================================

Each mini-lesson is structured like a YouTube tutorial.
Use them as scripts, narration guides, or teaching slides.

---

# **🎬 MINI LESSON 1 — “What Is Git?” (2 minutes)**

### **Scene 1 — Intro (00:00–00:10)**

**Visual:** Developer typing, files changing.
**Narration:**
"Imagine working on a project where you can undo mistakes, experiment freely, and collaborate with anyone. That’s what Git lets you do."

---

### **Scene 2 — Core Ideas (00:10–01:00)**

**Visual:** Diagrams of snapshots and branches.
**Narration:**
"Git tracks changes as snapshots called commits. You can create branches to try new features safely. And merge them when ready."

---

### **Scene 3 — Why GitHub? (01:00–01:40)**

**Visual:** GitHub UI.
**Narration:**
"GitHub stores your repositories online so you can collaborate, review code, and automate workflows using GitHub Actions."

---

### **Scene 4 — Summary (01:40–02:00)**

**Narration:**
"Git is version control. GitHub is collaboration. Together, they power modern software development."

---

# **🎬 MINI LESSON 2 — “Your First Commit” (3 minutes)**

### **Scene 1 — Create Project**

Show terminal:

```
mkdir hello-git
cd hello-git
git init
```

### **Scene 2 — Add File**

```
echo "Hello Git" > hello.txt
git add hello.txt
git commit -m "Add greeting"
```

### **Narration:**

"You’ve just created your first commit — your first snapshot."

---

# **🎬 MINI LESSON 3 — “Branches Explained Visually” (3 minutes)**

### **Scene: Whiteboard animation**

Narration:
"Branches let you develop features independently. Think of them as alternate timelines for your project."

Terminal demo:

```
git switch -c feature-login
```

"Now you’re safely editing without affecting main."

---

# **🎬 MINI LESSON 4 — “Push, Pull, and PRs” (4 minutes)**

### **Visual timeline** showing remote vs local.

Commands:

```
git push origin feature-login
```

Narration:
"Once you push your changes, you can open a Pull Request on GitHub. PRs let teammates review your work before merging."

---

# **🎬 MINI LESSON 5 — “Fixing Merge Conflicts” (4 minutes)**

Show conflict markers:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
Version A
=======
Version B
>>>>>>> feature
```

Narration:
"Conflicts happen when Git can’t auto-merge. Just pick the correct version, delete the markers, and commit the fix."
