Q. In a scenario where virtual machines (VMs) hosting Nginx web applications are part of the backend pool of an Azure Application Gateway, what are the different ways and locations where SSL certificates can be applied?

**Scenario Based Question**
Q. As a Senior DevOps Engineer, I've been assigned to a new project involving 30 developers split across three sub-teams (10 developers each). Each team manages a couple of applications currently hosted on on-premises infrastructure. My responsibility is to plan, design, and implement the security architecture for each environment and migrate all application infrastructure to Azure. There are no dedicated security or cloud teams involved, so I will be executing this project solo, with support from the development teams and development team have no idea about security or cloud. I need a detailed, step-by-step approach—from planning and proof of concept (PoC) to full migration—covering all technical and strategic aspects.
