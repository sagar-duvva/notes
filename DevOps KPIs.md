Here are the **most widely accepted and globally recognized DevOps KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)** that organizations use to measure the success and maturity of their DevOps practices:

---

### 🔹 **1. Deployment Frequency (DF)**

- **What it measures**: How often your organization successfully deploys code to production.
    
- **Why it matters**: Frequent deployments indicate agility and responsiveness.
    
- **Elite performers (per DORA)**: **Multiple deployments per day**
    

---

### 🔹 **2. Lead Time for Changes**

- **What it measures**: Time taken from code commit to code successfully running in production.
    
- **Why it matters**: Shorter lead times indicate faster innovation and faster delivery.
    
- **Elite performers**: **Less than one day**
    

---

### 🔹 **3. Change Failure Rate (CFR)**

- **What it measures**: Percentage of deployments that cause a failure in production requiring remediation.
    
- **Why it matters**: Low CFR shows stability and reliability of deployments.
    
- **Elite performers**: **0–15%**
    

---

### 🔹 **4. Mean Time to Restore (MTTR)**

- **What it measures**: Time taken to recover from a failure in production.
    
- **Why it matters**: Faster recovery improves availability and user trust.
    
- **Elite performers**: **Less than one hour**
    

---

### 🔹 **5. Availability / Uptime**

- **What it measures**: The percentage of time systems are up and running.
    
- **Why it matters**: High availability is essential for customer satisfaction and SLA commitments.
    
- **Typical Target**: **99.9% or higher (SaaS)**
    

---

### 🔹 **6. Automated Test Coverage**

- **What it measures**: Percentage of codebase covered by automated tests.
    
- **Why it matters**: Higher coverage leads to fewer bugs and more reliable releases.
    
- **Typical Goal**: **60–90%**, depending on criticality.
    

---

### 🔹 **7. Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)**

- **What it measures**: Average time to detect an issue in production.
    
- **Why it matters**: Faster detection reduces customer impact.
    

---

### 🔹 **8. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Coverage**

- **What it measures**: Percentage of infrastructure managed through code (e.g., Terraform, ARM, Bicep).
    
- **Why it matters**: Higher coverage increases consistency and enables automated changes.
    

---

### 🔹 **9. Build Success Rate**

- **What it measures**: Percentage of CI/CD pipeline builds that complete successfully.
    
- **Why it matters**: Consistent, green builds indicate stable code and environments.
    

---

### 🔹 **10. Change Volume**

- **What it measures**: Number of code commits, pull requests, features, or story points delivered per sprint or release.
    
- **Why it matters**: Helps assess development throughput and velocity.
    

---

### 🔹 **11. Rollback Frequency**

- **What it measures**: How often changes need to be rolled back from production.
    
- **Why it matters**: Frequent rollbacks indicate issues in testing or deployment quality.
    

---

### 🔹 **12. Cycle Time**

- **What it measures**: Time taken from starting a task (e.g., a user story) to its completion.
    
- **Why it matters**: Measures team agility and responsiveness to requirements.
    

---

### 🔹 **13. Release Downtime**

- **What it measures**: Downtime associated with deployments.
    
- **Why it matters**: Zero-downtime deployments are a sign of DevOps maturity.
    

---

### 🔹 **14. Customer Ticket Volume**

- **What it measures**: Number of user-reported incidents or bugs.
    
- **Why it matters**: Indicates production quality and user experience.
    

---

### 🔹 **15. Time to Value**

- **What it measures**: Time taken from idea to actual user-delivered value.
    
- **Why it matters**: Shorter time to value means faster innovation cycles.

## 📊 Bonus: DORA Metrics (Industry Standard)

The **four key DevOps KPIs recommended by Google’s DORA** (DevOps Research and Assessment) are:

1. **Deployment Frequency**
    
2. **Lead Time for Changes**
    
3. **Change Failure Rate**
    
4. **Mean Time to Restore**
    

These are considered **the gold standard** in DevOps performance measurement.
